# swp-theme
A starter WordPress theme based on Bootstrap 4 blog


I started with going to the Bootstrap 4 site and looking for the blog template. I got the page saved as an index.html, and a blog.css file, pulling everything else needed as a CDN.

Then I created the style.css and converted the index.html file to a .php file and that's the end of the first step. 
The theme is "done" right?
Nope

Next step was to chop up the page into a header.php, footer.php, sidebar.php and content.php files. "done" right? Nope

Next step was adding a few WP strings. And I have a ways to go. 

Functions, and other intermediate steps such as Pagination, Comments, Single Post, Functions, & Custom Posts. 

Then add a few advanced steps like Custom Posts, Custom Fields and Meta Boxes. And maybe add support for Internationalization.
